                    ✓ You may occasionally experience slower internet speeds. To confirm whether your connection is performing optimally, run an online speed test.<br>
                    ✓ Open your browser (e.g. Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) and visit www.speedtest.net.<br>
                    ✓ The test will display your current download and upload speeds.<br>
                    ✓ For accurate results, run the test close to your router and ensure only the testing device is connected.<br>
                    ✓ Depending on your internet package, a good result should be between 50% and 100% of your plan’s maximum speed.<br>
                    ✓ If your speeds are not optimal and you suspect a network issue, please contact us so we can assist with troubleshooting.

                <h3>What does the red LOS indicator mean for my network?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>LOS stands for Loss of Signal.
                    When the red indicator above LOS lights up and starts blinking, it means there’s a fiber issue.
                    This could be due to:
                    ✔ Fiber cut – usually occurs on the main cable running from our Fiber Access Terminal to your router.<br>
                    ✔ Loose patch cord – the slim cable connected to the back of your router. You can try carefully unplugging and reconnecting it to see if the red light stops blinking.<br>
                    If the issue persists, please contact us through our communication channels.
